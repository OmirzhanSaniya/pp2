#If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

#One line if statement:

a = 200
b = 33

if a > b: print("a is greater than b")


#If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

#One line if else statement:

a = 2
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("B")


#This technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions.

#One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
