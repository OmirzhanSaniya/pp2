#You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.

#Iterate through the items and print the values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for x in thistuple:
    print(x)



#You can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index number.
#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

#Print all items by referring to their index number:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for i in range(len(thistuple)):
    print(thistuple[i])    



#You can loop through the tuple items by using a while loop.
#Use the len() function to determine the length of the tuple, then start at 0 and loop your way through the tuple items by referring to their indexes.
#Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.

#Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

i = 0
while i < len(thistuple):
    print(thistuple[i])
    i = i + 1
