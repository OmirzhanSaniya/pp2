#The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

#Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
    print(x)

else:
    print("Finally finished!")




#The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.

#Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

for x in range(6):
    if x == 3: break
    print(x)

else:
    print("Finally finished!")

#If the loop breaks, the else block is not executed.
